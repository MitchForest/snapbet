# Sprint 05.00: Mock Data Enhancement Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**End Date**: TBD  
**Epic**: Epic 5 - Complete Betting System with Tail/Fade

**Sprint Goal**: Enhance existing mock users with realistic betting data, create comprehensive game schedules, and establish social betting relationships to demonstrate the full betting experience.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables demonstration of Story 1 (Credibility Problem) with realistic bet history
- Sets up data for Story 4 (Isolation Problem) with tail/fade relationships

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Add 30 days of historical betting data for all mock users
2. Generate realistic NFL and NBA game schedules with proper odds
3. Create pick posts and tail/fade relationships between mock users
4. Update user stats and badges based on betting performance
5. Seed group chat messages about betting

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/data/mock-betting-history.ts` | Generate historical bets for users | NOT STARTED |
| `scripts/enhance-mock-betting.ts` | Main script to run all enhancements | NOT STARTED |
| `supabase/migrations/016_betting_indexes.sql` | Add performance indexes | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `scripts/data/mock-games.ts` | Add NFL games, enhance odds generation | NOT STARTED |
| `scripts/data/mock-users.ts` | Ensure betting personalities are used | NOT STARTED |
| `scripts/seed-mock-data.ts` | Integrate new betting data generation | NOT STARTED |
| `types/database.ts` | Add any missing betting types | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Betting History Generation**:
   - Create bets for past 30 days based on personality types
   - Sharp Bettors: 58% win rate, focus on value plays
   - Square Bettors: 48% win rate, popular teams/overs
   - Fade Material: 38% win rate, consistently bad picks
   - Homer: 45% win rate, worse on their favorite team
   - Parlay Degen: 12% win rate, multiple leg bets

2. **Game Schedule Enhancement**:
   - NFL: Sunday 1pm/4pm, Monday/Thursday nights
   - NBA: Daily games with realistic scheduling
   - Proper odds based on spreads (-110 standard juice)
   - Some completed games for history

3. **Social Activity**:
   - Pick posts for recent bets (last 7 days)
   - Tail/fade relationships (popular users get more tails)
   - Comments on pick posts ("Let's ride!", "Fading this")
   - Group chat messages about games/bets

4. **Stats & Badges Update**:
   - Calculate actual win/loss records
   - Update bankroll history
   - Award appropriate weekly badges
   - Set up referral relationships

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Use deterministic randomness (seeded) for reproducible data
- Ensure temporal consistency (bets match game times)
- Maintain realistic betting patterns per personality

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Existing mock users with personalities
- Games table structure
- Bets and pick_actions tables

**Identified Risks**:
- Data volume might slow down dev environment
- Need to ensure consistency across related tables
