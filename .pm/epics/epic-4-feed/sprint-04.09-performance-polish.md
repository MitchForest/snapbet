# Sprint 04.09: Performance & Polish Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**End Date**: TBD  
**Epic**: Epic 4 - Feed & Social Engagement

**Sprint Goal**: Optimize performance across all Epic 4 features, add error handling, loading states, and ensure the entire social experience is polished and production-ready.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Ensures all social features work smoothly and reliably
- Creates professional, polished user experience

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Optimize feed scrolling to maintain 60 FPS
2. Add proper loading skeletons for all screens
3. Implement error boundaries and fallbacks
4. Add network status handling
5. Optimize image/video loading and caching
6. Add haptic feedback to social actions
7. Polish animations and transitions
8. Comprehensive testing of all Epic 4 features

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` | Catch and display errors gracefully | NOT STARTED |
| `components/common/NetworkStatus.tsx` | Show offline/online status | NOT STARTED |
| `components/skeletons/FeedSkeleton.tsx` | Loading state for feed | NOT STARTED |
| `components/skeletons/SearchSkeleton.tsx` | Loading state for search | NOT STARTED |
| `utils/performance/imageCache.ts` | Image caching utilities | NOT STARTED |
| `utils/performance/feedOptimization.ts` | Feed performance helpers | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/index.tsx` | Add error boundary, optimize FlashList | NOT STARTED |
| `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/search.tsx` | Add loading states, error handling | NOT STARTED |
| `components/content/PostCard.tsx` | Optimize re-renders, add memo | NOT STARTED |
| `hooks/useFeed.ts` | Add caching, optimize queries | NOT STARTED |
| `services/social/followService.ts` | Add retry logic, better errors | NOT STARTED |
| All Epic 4 screens | Add haptic feedback | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Memoize PostCard components
   - Implement getItemLayout for FlashList
   - Lazy load images with fade-in
   - Cancel requests on unmount
   - Debounce rapid actions

2. **Loading States**:
   - Skeleton screens for initial load
   - Inline loaders for actions
   - Progress indicators for uploads
   - Smooth transitions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Network errors: Show retry button
   - API errors: User-friendly messages
   - Validation errors: Inline feedback
   - Crash recovery: Error boundaries

4. **Polish Details**:
   - Haptic feedback on all taps
   - Smooth animations (300ms standard)
   - Consistent spacing/padding
   - Keyboard handling improvements

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Use React.memo for all list items
- Implement image caching with 1-week TTL
- Standard 300ms animation duration
- Haptic feedback for all primary actions

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- All Epic 4 features implemented
- Performance testing tools
- Device testing capabilities

**Identified Risks**:
- Performance varies by device
- Network conditions affect experience
- Memory leaks from subscriptions

## Key Code Additions

### New Functions/Components
```typescript
// components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Purpose: Catch errors and show fallback UI
  // Used by: Wrap around all screens
}

// utils/performance/imageCache.ts
export async function getCachedImage(url: string) {
  // Purpose: Return cached image or fetch and cache
  // Returns: Local file URI
}

// utils/performance/feedOptimization.ts
export const optimizedPostCard = React.memo(PostCard, (prev, next) => {
  // Purpose: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
  // Returns: true if props are equal
});
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
None - This sprint focuses on client-side optimization

### State Management
- Add request caching to reduce API calls
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Add abort controllers for cancellable requests
- Memory leak prevention

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Feed scrolls at 60 FPS on low-end device
- [ ] All loading states display correctly
- [ ] Error states show appropriate messages
- [ ] Offline mode shows cached content
- [ ] Haptic feedback works on all actions
- [ ] No memory leaks after extended use
- [ ] All animations smooth

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Feed FPS: Target 60, Actual: [X]
- [ ] Time to Interactive: Target <2s, Actual: [X]
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time
- [ ] Network requests optimized
- [ ] Bundle size impact minimal

### Edge Cases Considered
- Very slow network: Show appropriate feedback
- No network: Offline mode with cache
- Rapid navigation: Cancel pending requests
- Low memory: Graceful degradation
- Old devices: Reduced animations
