# Sprint 04.01: Feed Infrastructure Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Number**: 04.01  
**Sprint Name**: Feed Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 2.5 hours  
**Status**: HANDOFF  
**Dependencies**: Epic 3 (Camera & Content) must be complete

**Sprint Goal**: Create the main feed showing posts from followed users with FlashList for optimal performance, pagination, and real-time updates.

**User Stories Addressed**:
- Story 1: The Shared Experience Problem - Users can now see and engage with posts from people they follow
- Story 4: The Isolation Problem - Connected feed experience begins here

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use Tamagui components**: `View`, `Text`, `XStack`, `YStack`, `Stack`
- **Follow UI/UX rules**: See `.pm/process/ui-ux-consistency-rules.md`
- **Use Colors constant**: Import from `@/theme` - NEVER hardcode colors
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tamagui's `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. tokens

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Implementation Plan

**Status**: HANDOFF  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-19  
**End Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Epic**: Epic 4 - Feed & Social Engagement

**Sprint Goal**: Transform the current self-only feed into a high-performance social feed showing posts from followed users with real-time updates, pagination, and proper empty states.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables Story 1: Social Pick Sharing - Users can see picks from people they follow
- Enables Story 4: The Isolation Problem - Connect through following and seeing others' content

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. âœ… Migrate from FlatList to FlashList for superior performance
2. âœ… Update feed query to show posts from followed users (not just own posts)
3. âœ… Implement infinite scroll with pagination
4. âœ… Add real-time subscriptions for new posts from followed users
5. âœ… Create empty state for users with no follows
6. âœ… Add pull-to-refresh with haptic feedback
7. âœ… Handle offline/online states gracefully

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `hooks/useFeedPagination.ts` | Pagination logic for infinite scroll | COMPLETED |
| `components/feed/EmptyFeed.tsx` | Enhanced empty state component | COMPLETED |
| `components/feed/FeedSkeleton.tsx` | Loading skeleton for feed | COMPLETED |
| `services/feed/feedService.ts` | Feed query logic and caching | COMPLETED |
| `services/storage/storageService.ts` | Unified MMKV storage service | COMPLETED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/index.tsx` | Replace FlatList with FlashList, update layout | COMPLETED |
| `hooks/useFeed.ts` | Update to query followed users, add pagination | COMPLETED |
| `package.json` | Add @shopify/flash-list dependency | COMPLETED |
| `components/content/PostCard.tsx` | Optimize for FlashList rendering | NOT NEEDED |
| `hooks/useStories.ts` | Update to show followed users' stories | COMPLETED |
| `components/ui/StoriesBar.tsx` | Connect to real story data | COMPLETED |

### Implementation Approach

1. **FlashList Migration**: âœ…
   - Installed @shopify/flash-list
   - Replaced FlatList with FlashList in feed screen
   - Configured estimatedItemSize based on PostCard height
   - Set proper drawDistance and recycling settings

2. **Feed Query Update**: âœ…
   - Get user's following list first
   - Query posts from followed users + self
   - Order by created_at descending
   - Filter out expired posts
   - Include user data with proper relationship hints

3. **Pagination Implementation**: âœ…
   - Use cursor-based pagination (last post ID + timestamp)
   - Load 20 posts per page
   - Implement hasMore flag
   - Add loading more indicator

4. **Real-time Subscriptions**: âœ…
   - Subscribe to posts table for followed user IDs
   - Handle INSERT events for new posts
   - Prepend new posts to feed optimistically
   - Handle connection/disconnection gracefully

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Use cursor-based pagination over offset for better performance âœ…
- 20 posts per page balances load time and user experience âœ…
- Optimistic updates for real-time posts to feel instant âœ…
- Cache first page in MMKV for instant load on app open âœ…

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- @shopify/flash-list: ^1.6.0 âœ… (installed 1.8.3)
- Existing PostCard component from Epic 3 âœ…
- Following relationships from Epic 2 âœ…

**Identified Risks**:
- FlashList has different props than FlatList - need careful migration âœ… RESOLVED
- Real-time subscriptions with many follows could impact performance âœ… MITIGATED (limit to 100 follows)
- Empty state needs to guide users to search/discover âœ… RESOLVED

## Implementation Log

### Day-by-Day Progress
**2024-12-19**:
- Started: Feed infrastructure implementation
- Completed: All objectives achieved
- Blockers: None
- Decisions: 
  - Used composite cursor (timestamp + id) for stable pagination
  - Limited real-time to 100 follows for performance
  - Connected stories to actual data (bonus)

### Reality Checks & Plan Updates

**Reality Check 1** - Storage Service Architecture
- Issue: AsyncStorage used in some places, MMKV installed but not unified
- Options Considered:
  1. Keep AsyncStorage - Pros: No migration / Cons: Slower performance
  2. Create unified MMKV service - Pros: 30x faster, consistent / Cons: Migration needed
- Decision: Created unified MMKV storage service
- Plan Update: Added `services/storage/storageService.ts`
- Epic Impact: None - improves performance

### Code Quality Checks

**Linting Results**:
- [x] Initial run: 43 errors, 1 warning
- [x] Final run: 0 errors, 1 warning (React hook dependency - acceptable)

**Type Checking Results**:
- [x] Initial run: 1 error (unused component)
- [x] Final run: 0 errors

**Build Results**:

## Key Code Additions

### New Functions/Components
```typescript
// hooks/useFeedPagination.ts
export function useFeedPagination() {
  // Purpose: Handle infinite scroll pagination
  // Returns: { posts, loadMore, hasMore, isLoadingMore }
}

// services/feed/feedService.ts  
export async function getFeedPosts(userId: string, cursor?: FeedCursor) {
  // Purpose: Query posts from followed users with pagination
  // Returns: { posts: Post[], nextCursor: string | null }
}

// services/storage/storageService.ts
export const Storage = {
  feed: new MMKVStorage(feedStorage),
  settings: new MMKVStorage(settingsStorage),
  general: new MMKVStorage(generalStorage),
};
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
| Method | Path | Request | Response | Status |
|--------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| GET | /feed | `{ cursor?: string, limit: number }` | `{ posts: Post[], nextCursor?: string }` | USING SUPABASE |

### State Management
- Feed posts stored in component state with pagination hook âœ…
- Pagination cursor tracked in useFeedPagination hook âœ…
- Following list cached in service layer âœ…
- First page cached in MMKV for instant load âœ…

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
