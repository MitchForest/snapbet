3. Update bankroll reset logic to include bonuses
4. Create referral statistics display
5. Add deep link support for referral codes

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `services/referral/referralRewardService.ts` | Referral reward calculations | NOT STARTED |
| `components/referral/ReferralBonusDisplay.tsx` | Show bonus amount in bankroll | NOT STARTED |
| `components/referral/ReferralStatsCard.tsx` | Enhanced stats with rewards | NOT STARTED |
| `hooks/useReferralRewards.ts` | Referral rewards state | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `services/referral/referralService.ts` | Add reward tracking logic | NOT STARTED |
| `app/(drawer)/invite.tsx` | Show reward information prominently | NOT STARTED |
| `components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx` | Display referral bonus if any | NOT STARTED |
| `services/badges/badgeResetService.ts` | Include referral bonus in weekly reset | NOT STARTED |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | Handle deep links for referral codes | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Database Update**:
   ```sql
   -- Already in epic tracker
   ALTER TABLE bankrolls ADD COLUMN
     referral_bonus integer DEFAULT 0; -- in cents
   ```

2. **Reward Calculation**:
   ```typescript
   // Weekly bankroll = base + (referrals * bonus)
   const calculateWeeklyBankroll = (referralCount: number) => {
     const BASE_BANKROLL = 100000; // $1,000 in cents
     const REFERRAL_BONUS = 10000;  // $100 in cents
     return BASE_BANKROLL + (referralCount * REFERRAL_BONUS);
   };
   ```

3. **Deep Link Handling**:
   - URL format: `snapbet://invite/[CODE]`
   - Web fallback: `https://snapbet.app/invite/[CODE]`
   - Store code during onboarding
   - Apply after first bet (future)

4. **Display Updates**:
   - Bankroll: "$1,100 ($100 referral bonus)"
   - Profile: "3 referrals â€¢ +$300/week"
   - Invite: "Earn $100 weekly for each friend"

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Bonuses are permanent (not one-time)
- Apply to weekly reset, not immediate
- Track but don't reward until Epic 5 (betting)
- Show potential rewards to incentivize

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Existing referral tracking from Epic 2
- Bankroll system from Epic 2
- Deep linking setup for mobile

**Identified Risks**:
- Referral fraud potential (track for patterns)
- Bankroll inflation if too successful
- Deep link configuration complexity

}
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
| Method | Path | Request | Response | Status |
|--------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| GET | /referrals/rewards | - | `{ referralCount, weeklyBonus, totalEarned }` | PLANNED |
| POST | /referrals/apply-bonus | - | `{ success: boolean, newBankroll: number }` | PLANNED |

### State Management
- Referral bonus in bankroll state
- Referral count cached
- Deep link code in AsyncStorage
- Reward stats in profile

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Referral bonus calculates correctly
- [ ] Weekly reset includes bonus
- [ ] Deep links work on iOS
- [ ] Deep links work on Android
- [ ] Invite screen shows rewards
- [ ] Profile shows bonus amount
- [ ] Stats update in real-time

### Edge Cases Considered
- User with 0 referrals: Show base bankroll
- User with many referrals: Cap display
- Invalid referral code: Show error
- Self-referral attempt: Prevent
- Referral after betting starts: Queue for next week
