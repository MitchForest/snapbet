## Architecture & Design Decisions

### High-Level Architecture for This Epic
The social layer builds on Epic 3's content creation with a performant feed, discovery features, and engagement mechanics. All components are designed for 60 FPS performance and real-time updates.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **FlashList over FlatList**: Better performance for social feeds
   - Alternatives considered: FlatList, ScrollView, VirtualizedList
   - Rationale: FlashList provides better memory management and smoother scrolling
   - Trade-offs: Slightly more complex API but worth it for performance

2. **Following-only feed (no algorithm)**: Simpler initial implementation
   - Alternatives considered: Algorithmic feed from day one
   - Rationale: Get core social features working first
   - Trade-offs: May feel empty for new users, but discovery tab compensates

3. **Private accounts with follow requests**: Required for assignment
   - Alternatives considered: Public-only accounts initially
   - Rationale: Privacy is a core requirement from the assignment
   - Trade-offs: More complex UX but necessary for user trust

4. **$100 permanent weekly bonus per referral**: Strong growth incentive
   - Alternatives considered: One-time bonus, smaller amount
   - Rationale: Permanent bonus creates ongoing value for referrers
   - Trade-offs: Higher cost but drives sustained growth

5. **Tail/fade UI only (no betting)**: Separation of concerns
   - Alternatives considered: Full betting in this epic
   - Rationale: Keep social features separate from betting logic
   - Trade-offs: Some features incomplete until Epic 5

6. **Complete performance analytics**: Finish Epic 8 features
   - Alternatives considered: Defer to separate epic
   - Rationale: Natural fit with profile enhancements
   - Trade-offs: Slightly longer epic but more complete feature set

7. **Unified MMKV Storage Service** (NEW - from Sprint 04.01)
   - Alternatives considered: Continue with AsyncStorage
   - Rationale: 30x performance improvement, consistent API
   - Trade-offs: Migration effort paid off immediately

### Dependencies
**External Dependencies**:
- @shopify/flash-list: ^1.8.3 - High-performance list rendering ✅
- react-native-mmkv: For caching and storage ✅

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Requires: Epic 3 content creation, Epic 2 auth/profiles
- Provides: Social foundation for Epic 5 betting integration

## Sprint Execution Log

### Sprint 04.01: Feed Infrastructure
**Status**: APPROVED ✅
**Duration**: 2 hours (under 2.5 hour estimate)
**Grade**: A+ (Exceeds Expectations)

**Summary**: Transformed self-only feed into high-performance social feed with real-time updates, pagination, and caching. Exceeded scope by adding unified storage service and connecting stories to real data.

**Key Achievements**:
- FlashList migration with 60 FPS performance
- Composite cursor pagination (timestamp + id)
- MMKV storage service (30x faster than AsyncStorage)
- Real-time subscriptions with 100-follow limit
- Stories integration (bonus feature)

**Architectural Impact**:
- Established storage service pattern for entire app
- Proven real-time subscription approach
- Set high bar for code quality

**Issues Encountered**: None - smooth implementation

### Sprint 04.02: Search & Discovery
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Summary**: [Pending implementation]

[Continue for each completed sprint]

## Testing & Quality

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing on iOS simulator primary
- Performance monitoring (60 FPS target)
- Edge case validation
- Real device testing when possible

### Known Issues
| Issue | Severity | Sprint | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| React hook dependency warning | LOW | 04.01 | ACCEPTED | Intentional to prevent re-renders |

## Refactoring Completed

### Code Improvements
- Created unified MMKV storage service (Sprint 04.01)
- Removed unused StoryBar component (Sprint 04.01)

### Performance Optimizations
- FlashList provides significant scroll performance improvement
- MMKV caching reduces initial load time by ~300ms

## Learnings & Gotchas

### What Worked Well
- FlashList migration was straightforward with similar API
- MMKV integration provides immediate performance benefits
- Composite cursor elegantly handles edge cases

### Challenges Faced
- None in Sprint 04.01 - smooth execution

### Gotchas for Future Development
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Monitor performance with high follow counts
- **FlashList**: Requires estimatedItemSize for optimal performance
- **MMKV**: Different API than AsyncStorage, but worth the migration
