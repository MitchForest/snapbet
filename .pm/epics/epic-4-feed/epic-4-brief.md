```

### State Management Updates
```typescript
interface SocialState {
  // Feed state
  feedPosts: Post[];
  hasMore: boolean;
  isRefreshing: boolean;
  
  // Following state
  following: string[];
  followers: string[];
  followRequests: FollowRequest[];
  
  // Discovery state
  searchQuery: string;
  searchResults: User[];
  hotBettors: User[];
  trendingPicks: Pick[];
  
  // Privacy state
  isPrivate: boolean;
  showBankroll: boolean;
  showStats: boolean;
  blockedUsers: string[];
  
  // Actions
  followUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  unfollowUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  blockUser: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  reportContent: (contentId: string, reason: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Database Considerations
```sql
-- New tables/columns needed
follow_requests (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  requester_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  requested_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at timestamp,
  UNIQUE(requester_id, requested_id)
);

blocked_users (
  blocker_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  blocked_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at timestamp,
  PRIMARY KEY(blocker_id, blocked_id)
);

reports (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  reporter_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  content_type text, -- 'post', 'user', 'comment'
  content_id uuid,
  reason text,
  created_at timestamp
);

referrals (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  referrer_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  referred_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  code text UNIQUE,
  created_at timestamp
);

-- Update users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN
  is_private boolean DEFAULT false,
  show_bankroll boolean DEFAULT true,
  show_stats boolean DEFAULT true,
  referral_code text UNIQUE;
```
