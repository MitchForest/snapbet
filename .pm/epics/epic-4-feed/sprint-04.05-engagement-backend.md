# Sprint 04.05: Engagement Backend Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**End Date**: TBD  
**Epic**: Epic 4 - Feed & Social Engagement

**Sprint Goal**: Connect the existing engagement UI components (comments, reactions, tail/fade buttons) to the backend with real-time updates and proper data persistence.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables Story 1: Social Pick Sharing - Full engagement on shared content
- Enables Story 4: The Isolation Problem - Connect through comments and reactions

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Connect comment system UI to database
2. Implement reaction system with 6 emoji types
3. Add real-time updates for comments and reactions
4. Create tail/fade UI for pick posts (backend in Epic 5)
5. Update engagement counts in real-time
6. Add engagement notifications
7. Implement comment moderation (delete own comments)
8. Add "who reacted" modal functionality

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `services/engagement/commentService.ts` | Comment CRUD operations | NOT STARTED |
| `services/engagement/reactionService.ts` | Reaction management | NOT STARTED |
| `hooks/useComments.ts` | Comment state with real-time updates | NOT STARTED |
| `hooks/useReactions.ts` | Reaction state management | NOT STARTED |
| `components/engagement/WhoReactedModal.tsx` | Show users who reacted | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `components/engagement/sheets/CommentSheet.tsx` | Connect to backend | NOT STARTED |
| `components/engagement/ReactionPicker.tsx` | Wire up reaction creation | NOT STARTED |
| `components/engagement/display/EngagementCounts.tsx` | Real-time count updates | NOT STARTED |
| `components/content/PostCard.tsx` | Update engagement integration | NOT STARTED |
| `hooks/useEngagement.ts` | Replace mock data with real queries | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Comments System**:
   ```typescript
   // Comment structure
   interface Comment {
     id: string;
     post_id: string;
     user_id: string;
     content: string; // max 280 chars
     created_at: string;
     user: {
       username: string;
       avatar_url?: string;
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Reactions System**:
   - 6 allowed emojis: ðŸ”¥ðŸ’°ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ’¯ðŸŽ¯
   - One reaction per user per post
   - Can change reaction (replaces previous)
   - Aggregate counts by emoji type

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Subscribe to comments table for post
   - Subscribe to reactions table for post
   - Update counts optimistically
   - Show new comments as they arrive

4. **Tail/Fade UI** (Backend in Epic 5):
   - Show buttons only on pick posts
   - Display current tail/fade counts
   - Show "Coming Soon" toast on tap
   - Prepare UI for Epic 5 integration

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Comments limited to 280 characters (Twitter-like)
- Reactions use database constraints for one-per-user
- Real-time subscriptions scoped to visible posts only
- Optimistic updates with rollback on error

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Comments and reactions tables exist
- Notification service from Epic 2
- PostCard component from Epic 3

**Identified Risks**:
- Real-time subscriptions for many posts could impact performance
- Comment spam potential (rate limiting needed)
- Ensuring counts stay accurate with concurrent updates

## Key Code Additions

### New Functions/Components
```typescript
// services/engagement/commentService.ts
export async function addComment(postId: string, content: string) {
  // Purpose: Add a comment to a post
  // Returns: { comment: Comment }
}

export async function deleteComment(commentId: string) {
  // Purpose: Delete own comment
  // Returns: { success: boolean }
}

// services/engagement/reactionService.ts
export async function toggleReaction(postId: string, emoji: string) {
  // Purpose: Add/update/remove reaction
  // Returns: { reaction?: Reaction }
}

// hooks/useComments.ts
export function useComments(postId: string) {
  // Purpose: Manage comments with real-time updates
  // Returns: { comments, addComment, deleteComment, isLoading }
}
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
| Method | Path | Request | Response | Status |
|--------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| POST | /posts/:id/comments | `{ content: string }` | `{ comment: Comment }` | PLANNED |
| DELETE | /comments/:id | - | `{ success: boolean }` | PLANNED |
| POST | /posts/:id/reactions | `{ emoji: string }` | `{ reaction?: Reaction }` | PLANNED |
| GET | /posts/:id/reactions/users | `{ emoji: string }` | `{ users: User[] }` | PLANNED |

### State Management
- Comments cached per post with real-time sync
- Reactions aggregated with user's reaction highlighted
- Engagement counts updated optimistically
- Subscription cleanup on unmount

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Can add comments to posts
- [ ] Comments appear in real-time for all viewers
- [ ] Can delete own comments
- [ ] Reactions toggle correctly
- [ ] Only one reaction per user enforced
- [ ] Reaction counts update instantly
- [ ] "Who reacted" shows correct users
- [ ] Tail/fade buttons show on pick posts only

### Edge Cases Considered
- Rapid reaction changes: Debounce API calls
- Long comments: Enforce 280 char limit
- Deleted post: Handle gracefully
- Network issues: Queue actions for retry
- Many comments: Implement pagination

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Comment system architecture documented
- [ ] Reaction constraints documented
- [ ] Real-time subscription patterns documented
- [ ] Engagement notification types documented
