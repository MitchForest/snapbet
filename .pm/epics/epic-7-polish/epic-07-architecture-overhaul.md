# Epic 7: Architecture Overhaul & Polish

## Overview
Complete architectural restructuring of the Snapbet codebase to implement a scalable, maintainable, and testable architecture following industry best practices.

## Goals
1. Implement feature-first modular architecture
2. Establish proper separation of concerns with layered architecture
3. Create comprehensive testing infrastructure
4. Enhance state management patterns
5. Improve developer experience and code quality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage across critical paths
- [ ] All features organized in self-contained modules
- [ ] Zero circular dependencies
- [ ] Consistent error handling across the application
- [ ] Performance metrics improved by 20%
- [ ] Developer onboarding time reduced by 50%

## Timeline
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **Target Completion**: 6-8 weeks
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers

## Risk Factors
1. **High** - Breaking existing functionality during migration
2. **Medium** - Team learning curve for new patterns
3. **Medium** - Merge conflicts with ongoing feature development
4. **Low** - Performance regression during transition

## Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive test suite before migration
2. Feature flags for gradual rollout
3. Dedicated migration branch with daily rebases
4. Performance benchmarking before/after

## Dependencies
- No active feature development during core migration phases
- Design system documentation completed
- CI/CD pipeline setup for automated testing
