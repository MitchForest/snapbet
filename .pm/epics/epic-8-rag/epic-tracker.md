## Architecture & Design Decisions

### High-Level Architecture for This Epic
- **Service Layer**: New `services/rag/` directory with specialized AI services
- **Database Layer**: pgvector extension for similarity search, embedding storage
- **Integration Points**: Hooks into existing post creation, feed, search, and betting flows
- **No Module System**: Following existing service-based architecture pattern

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Service Architecture vs Modules**: Use existing service pattern, not module system
   - Alternatives considered: Module-based architecture
   - Rationale: Consistency with existing codebase structure
   - Trade-offs: Less isolation but better integration

2. **Embedding Strategy**: Generate on content creation vs historical backfill
   - Alternatives considered: Batch backfill all historical content
   - Rationale: Start fresh to control costs and complexity
   - Trade-offs: No AI features for old content initially

3. **Archive Approach**: Hybrid approach with both `archived` and `deleted_at`
   - Alternatives considered: Use only `deleted_at` for everything
   - Rationale: Clear semantics between expired content (archived) vs deleted content
   - Trade-offs: Additional column but clearer intent and better performance

4. **Feed Mixing**: Simple injection pattern vs complex scoring
   - Alternatives considered: ML-based ranking algorithm
   - Rationale: Predictable behavior, easier to tune
   - Trade-offs: Less sophisticated but more maintainable

5. **Consensus Detection**: Database query vs real-time stream processing
   - Alternatives considered: Redis streams for real-time
   - Rationale: Simpler implementation, good enough for MVP
   - Trade-offs: Slight delay in notifications

6. **AI Visual Indicators**: Unified badge component with sparkle icon
   - Alternatives considered: Different icons per feature, no indicators
   - Rationale: Consistent branding, user awareness of AI features
   - Trade-offs: Additional UI element but clear feature attribution

### Dependencies
**External Dependencies**:
- `openai`: ^4.0.0 - For embeddings and chat completions
- `pgvector`: PostgreSQL extension - For vector similarity search

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Requires: Existing Supabase setup, post/bet/user tables, notification system
- Provides: AI capabilities for future features, embedding infrastructure

## Sprint Execution Log

### Sprint 8.01: Database Infrastructure
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Duration**: 2 hours (planned 4 hours)  
**Completed**: 2024-12-29  
**Summary**: Successfully implemented complete database infrastructure for RAG features including pgvector extension, archive columns on all ephemeral tables, embedding columns for AI features, and RPC functions for vector similarity search.

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Enabled pgvector 0.8.0 extension in Supabase
- Added archive columns to all 6 ephemeral tables (posts, bets, stories, messages, reactions, pick_actions)
- Added embedding columns to posts, bets, and users tables
- Created embedding_metadata table for tracking
- Implemented 3 RPC functions with privacy filters (find_similar_users, find_similar_posts, check_bet_consensus)
- Created performance indexes using ivfflat
- Regenerated TypeScript types with 0 errors

**Key Decisions**: 
- Used migration 033 (not 032) based on existing migrations
- Kept notification types as strings with documentation (no enum) for backward compatibility
- Added indexes for posts, bets, AND stories (high-traffic tables)
- Used ivfflat with lists=100 for balanced performance
- Skip .env.example creation due to file restrictions

**Technical Notes**:
- pgvector 0.8.0 available but required manual enablement
- Supabase MCP transactions handled automatically (no BEGIN/COMMIT)
- Type generation requires formatting fixes with `lint --fix`
- Cascading type changes required updates to 3 components

**Issues Encountered**: 
- Type generation formatting issues (resolved with lint --fix)
- Three components needed updates for new optional fields (resolved)
- No notification_type enum exists (kept as string type with documentation)

**Review Outcome**: APPROVED (2024-12-29)
- All quality checks passing (0 lint errors, 0 type errors)
- Database migration verified via MCP
- RPC functions tested and working
- TypeScript types properly aligned

### Sprint 8.02: Content Archiving  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Duration**: 1.5 hours (planned 2 hours)  
**Completed**: 2024-12-29  
**Summary**: Successfully modified content-expiration job to archive content instead of deleting it, preserving data for RAG features while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Modified expiration logic for posts, stories, and messages to use `archived: true`
- Added weekly bet archiving (7 days old) running hourly
- Added engagement data archiving for reactions and pick_actions (3 days old)
- Maintained `deleted_at` for user/moderation deletions
- Updated all logging messages to reflect archiving operations
- All queries properly check both `archived=false` and `deleted_at is null`

**Key Decisions**:
- Kept hourly schedule (not 5 minutes) for production stability
- Implemented without initial batching (can add if performance issues arise)
- Used simple age-based logic for archiving instead of complex scheduling
- Separated mock data generation to Sprint 8.10 for clean separation of concerns

**Technical Notes**:
- Import path fixed to use scripts/supabase-client
- All archive operations follow consistent pattern
- Limit option supported for future batch processing needs

**Issues Encountered**:
- Job CLI has React Native import issues (doesn't affect cron execution)
- Resolved by using scripts-specific supabase client

**Review Outcome**: APPROVED (2024-12-29)
- All quality checks passing (0 lint errors, 0 type errors)
- Archive logic correctly implemented
- Production-ready code without mock data concerns

### Sprint 8.03: Archive Filtering
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Duration**: 2.5 hours (planned 3 hours)
**Completed**: 2024-12-29
**Summary**: Successfully implemented comprehensive archive filtering across all user-facing queries, ensuring users only see active content while preserving archived data for AI/RAG features.

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Created centralized archive filter utility with type-safe helper functions
- Updated 18 files across services, hooks, and components
- Applied archive filtering to 25+ database queries
- Handled complex parent-child relationships (comments check parent post status)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing deleted_at filtering
- Zero lint errors, zero type errors

**Key Decisions**:
- Used flexible type system with generic constraints for Supabase compatibility
- Applied filters early in query chain for performance
- Deferred performance indexes and real-time filtering to Sprint 8.10
- Comments use inner joins to check parent post archive status

**Deferred to Sprint 8.10**:
1. Settlement service edge case handling
2. Real-time subscription archive filtering
3. Performance indexes for archive queries
4. Additional job script reviews

**Review Outcome**: HANDOFF (2024-12-29)

### Sprint 8.04: RAG Service Layer  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Duration**: 3 hours (planned 4 hours)  
**Completed**: 2024-12-30  
**Summary**: Successfully implemented core RAG service layer with OpenAI integration, embedding pipeline, and production job infrastructure that works seamlessly with both mock and real data.

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Implemented RAGService with OpenAI integration for embeddings and completions
- Created EmbeddingPipeline for posts, bets, and user profiles
- Built production embedding-generation job for archived content
- Integrated two-phase mock setup (historical → archive → embed → fresh)
- Added AIBadge component with proper Tamagui theming
- Hooked embedding generation into post/bet creation (async, non-blocking)

**Key Decisions**:
- Production-first approach: all embedding generation uses production jobs
- Two-phase mock generation mimics real usage patterns
- Async by default to maintain UI responsiveness
- Rate limiting with in-memory Map for simplicity
- Error boundaries prevent AI failures from breaking core features

**Technical Excellence**:
- Same code path for mock and real data ensures reliability
- Production jobs handle both contexts seamlessly
- Proper separation of concerns (/scripts/jobs vs /scripts/mock)
- Graceful error handling with continuation on failures

**Review Outcome**: APPROVED (2024-12-30)
- All quality checks passing (0 lint errors, 0 type errors)
- Production job architecture validated
- Mock integration creates realistic timeline
- Ready for upcoming AI features

### Sprint 8.05 (ORIGINAL): AI Caption Generation
**Status**: DEFERRED - EDGE FUNCTION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED
**Duration**: Investigation phase complete (3 hours)
**Started**: 2024-12-30
**Summary**: Feature requires real-time server processing via Edge Functions which are not deployed.

**Key Findings**:
- Edge Function code exists at `/supabase/functions/generate-caption/index.ts`
- No deployment infrastructure configured
- OpenAI SDK cannot run in React Native
- UI components (AICaptionButton, useAICaption) created but non-functional

**Deferred Until**: Edge Function infrastructure is deployed and configured

### Known Issues
| Issue | Severity | Sprint | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| [TBD] | - | - | - | - |

## Refactoring Completed

### Code Improvements
- [To be documented as completed]

### Performance Optimizations
- [To be documented as completed]

## Learnings & Gotchas

### What Worked Well
- Supabase MCP integration for database operations
- ivfflat indexes with lists=100 provide good balance
- Type generation with Supabase CLI is reliable
- Archive approach provides clear semantics

### Challenges Faced
- Type generation formatting requires manual fix
- Component updates needed for new optional fields
- Transaction handling differs in Supabase MCP

### Gotchas for Future Development
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Need to implement retry logic and queuing for high volume
- **Vector Index Performance**: May need to tune HNSW parameters for large datasets
- **Privacy Considerations**: Always filter embeddings by blocked users and private accounts
- **Async Processing**: Embeddings must not block UI - always process in background
- **Bet Structure**: Remember bets use `bet_details` JSON and sports come from games table
- **Environment Variables**: Use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` not `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Notification Creation**: Direct database insert, no service method exists
- **Archive Filtering**: 29+ files need archive filtering - use utility functions for consistency
- **Type Updates**: Vector type may need special handling in TypeScript
- **Existing Discovery**: Hook into existing discovery system, don't replace it
- **Feed Integration**: Feed service returns only following posts currently - needs complete rewrite
- **Camera Flow**: AI caption must integrate into existing camera/preview flow
- **Supabase MCP Transactions**: Cannot use BEGIN/COMMIT - system handles transactions automatically
- **Type Generation**: Always run `lint --fix` after generating types
- **Component Updates**: New database fields may require updates to existing components

## Build Testing & Verification

### Epic-End Build Process (MANDATORY)

Before marking an epic as complete, the following build verification MUST be performed:

1. **Clean all caches:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache .tamagui ios/build android/build
   ```

2. **Force clean prebuild for both platforms:**
   ```bash
   bun expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
   bun expo prebuild --platform android --clean
   ```

3. **Run full quality checks:**
   ```bash
   bun run lint      # MUST return 0 errors, 0 warnings
   bun run typecheck # MUST return 0 errors
   ```

4. **Test builds on both platforms:**
   ```bash
   # iOS
   bun expo run:ios
   
   # Android
   bun expo run:android
   ```

5. **Verification checklist:**
   - [ ] App launches without crashes on iOS
