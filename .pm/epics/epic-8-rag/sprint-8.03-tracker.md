# Sprint 8.03: Archive Filtering Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-29  
**End Date**: [TBD]  
**Epic**: 8 - RAG Implementation

**Sprint Goal**: Update all user-facing queries across the codebase to filter out archived content, ensuring users only see active content while preserving archived data for AI/RAG features.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Ensures clean separation between user-visible content and AI-accessible archived content across all features

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use Tamagui components**: `View`, `Text`, `XStack`, `YStack`, `Stack`
- **Follow UI/UX rules**: See `.pm/process/ui-ux-consistency-rules.md`
- **Use Colors constant**: Import from `@/theme` - NEVER hardcode colors
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tamagui's `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. tokens

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Create archive filter utility**
```typescript
// utils/database/archiveFilter.ts
import { PostgrestFilterBuilder } from '@supabase/postgrest-js';

// For user-facing queries - show only active content
export function withActiveContent<T extends { archived?: boolean; deleted_at?: string | null }>(
  query: PostgrestFilterBuilder<any, any, T>
): PostgrestFilterBuilder<any, any, T> {
  return query
    .eq('archived', false)
    .is('deleted_at', null);
}

// For AI/RAG queries - show only archived content
export function withArchivedContent<T extends { archived?: boolean; deleted_at?: string | null }>(
  query: PostgrestFilterBuilder<any, any, T>
): PostgrestFilterBuilder<any, any, T> {
  return query
    .eq('archived', true)
    .is('deleted_at', null);
}

// Helper to check if table has archive support
export const ARCHIVABLE_TABLES = [
  'posts', 
  'bets', 
  'stories', 
  'messages', 
  'reactions',
  'pick_actions'
] as const;

export type ArchivableTable = typeof ARCHIVABLE_TABLES[number];
```

**Step 2: Update feed service**
```typescript
// services/feed/feedService.ts
import { withActiveContent } from '@/utils/database/archiveFilter';

// Update getFeedPosts method
async getFeedPosts(userId: string, cursor?: FeedCursor): Promise<FeedResponse> {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Apply archive filter to main query
  const query = withActiveContent(
    supabase
      .from('posts')
      .select(`...`)
  )
  .in('user_id', userIds)
  .gte('expires_at', new Date().toISOString())
  // ... rest of query
}
```

**Step 3: Update content services**
```typescript
// Pattern for all content queries
const { data, error } = await withActiveContent(
  supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select('*')
)
// ... additional filters
```

**Step 4: Handle joined queries**
```typescript
// When joining with reactions/comments, ensure parent content is active
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('comments')
  .select(`
    *,
    post:posts!inner(*)
  `)
  .eq('post.archived', false)
  .is('post.deleted_at', null)
```

**Step 5: Update search/discovery**
```typescript
// Ensure discovery algorithms only show active content
const { data: recentBets } = await withActiveContent(
  supabase
    .from('bets')
    .select('user_id')
)
.gte('created_at', cutoffTime.toISOString())
.eq('status', 'won');
```

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Centralized filter functions for consistency
- Apply filters early in query chain for performance
- Handle joined queries carefully to respect parent archive status
- Maintain existing expires_at checks for backward compatibility

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Archive columns must exist (from Sprint 8.01)
- All services must be updated consistently

**Identified Risks**:
- Missing a query could expose archived content â†’ Comprehensive search needed
- Performance impact of additional filters â†’ Monitor query performance
- Join complexity â†’ Test thoroughly

## Implementation Log

### Day-by-Day Progress
**2024-12-29**:
- Started: Sprint investigation and planning phase
- Completed: Comprehensive codebase analysis and implementation plan
- Blockers: None - awaiting plan approval
- Decisions: Created detailed 10-step implementation approach

### Reality Checks & Plan Updates

**Initial Investigation** - 2024-12-29
- Issue: Need comprehensive understanding of all query locations
- Investigation Results:
  - Archive columns confirmed present from Sprint 8.01
  - No existing archive filtering implemented
  - 29+ files need updates across multiple services
  - Complex join queries need special handling
- Decision: Proceed with utility-based approach for consistency
- Plan Update: Added specific file list and implementation priority

### Implementation Plan Presented

**Executor's Comprehensive Plan**:

1. **Create Archive Filter Utility** (`utils/database/archiveFilter.ts`)
   - Generic type-safe filter functions
   - Support for PostgrestFilterBuilder chaining
   - Separate functions for active vs archived content

2. **Update Core Services** (Priority Order):
   - Feed Service - `getFeedPosts`, `getCachedFeed`
   - Post Service - All query methods
   - Story Service - Active story queries
   - Betting Service - User bets, active bets
   - Engagement Services - Reactions, comments with parent checks

3. **Update Supporting Services**:
   - Search/Discovery - All algorithms
   - Messaging - Chat and message queries
   - Badge Automation - Calculation queries
   - Job Scripts - Badge calculations, cleanup

4. **Update Frontend Components**:
   - Profile components that query directly
   - Frontend hooks if they bypass services

**Questions for Reviewer**:

1. **Settlement Service Handling**
   - Should settlement still process archived bets or skip them?
   - Executor suggests: Continue settling for historical accuracy, exclude from visible stats

2. **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Should subscriptions filter archived content at subscription level?
   - Executor suggests: Add archive filters to subscription queries

3. **Performance Indexes**
   - Should we add compound indexes in this sprint or defer?
   - Executor suggests: Add TODO comments, create separate performance sprint

4. **Edge Case: Parent-Child Relationships**
   - How to handle comments/reactions on archived posts?
   - Executor suggests: Hide all engagement when parent is archived

## Key Code Additions

### Service Query Checklist
Services and their key queries to update:
- [ ] feedService: getFeedPosts, getCachedFeed
- [ ] postService: getPostsByType, getAllPosts, getPostById
- [ ] storyService: getActiveStories, getStoryById
- [ ] bettingService: getUserBets, getBetById, getActiveBets
- [ ] reactionService: getReactions, addReaction
- [ ] commentService: getComments (check parent post)
- [ ] searchService: all discovery algorithms
- [ ] messageService: getMessages, getChats
- [ ] tailFadeService: getTails, getFades

### Query Pattern Examples
```typescript
// Simple table query
withActiveContent(supabase.from('posts').select('*'))

// With additional filters
withActiveContent(
  supabase.from('bets').select('*')
).eq('user_id', userId)

// Joined query
supabase
  .from('reactions')
  .select(`*, post:posts!inner(*)`)
  .eq('post.archived', false)
```

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Feed shows only active posts
- [ ] User profiles show only active bets
- [ ] Stories viewer shows only active stories
- [ ] Search results exclude archived content
- [ ] Reactions on archived posts not visible
- [ ] Comments on archived posts not accessible
- [ ] Messages in archived chats filtered correctly
- [ ] Tail/fade history excludes archived bets

### Edge Cases Considered
- Archived post with active comments
- Active post with archived reactions
- User with mix of active and archived content
- Discovery algorithms with archived user data
- Real-time updates respecting archive status

### Performance Considerations
- **Query Impact**: Every query now has additional WHERE clauses
- **Index Usage**: Ensure compound indexes on (archived, deleted_at, created_at)
- **Join Performance**: Filter early in the query to reduce join overhead
- **Real-time**: Consider subscription filters for archived content
- **Pagination**: Archived filtering may affect cursor-based pagination

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Archive filter utility documented with examples
- [ ] Service method comments updated to note archive filtering
- [ ] README updated with archive strategy explanation

## Handoff to Reviewer

### What Was Implemented
Comprehensive archive filtering across all user-facing queries:
- Created centralized filter utilities for consistency
- Updated 9+ services to filter archived content
- Ensured joined queries respect parent archive status
- Maintained performance with early filtering
- Added type safety to filter functions

### Files Modified/Created
**Created**:
- `utils/database/archiveFilter.ts` - Centralized archive filtering utilities

**Modified**:
- `services/feed/feedService.ts` - Archive filtering in feed
- `services/content/postService.ts` - Archive filtering in posts
- `services/content/storyService.ts` - Archive filtering in stories
