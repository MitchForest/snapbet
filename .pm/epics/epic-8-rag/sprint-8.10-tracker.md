# Sprint 8.10: RAG Mock Data Generation Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Start Date**: [TBD]  
**End Date**: [TBD]  
**Epic**: 8 - RAG Implementation

**Sprint Goal**: Create mock data generators and scenarios specifically for demonstrating RAG features, including archived content with various timestamps and patterns for AI learning.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables comprehensive testing and demonstration of all RAG features with realistic archived data

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Create RAG demo data generator with archived content
2. Generate content with similar captions for AI training
3. Create consensus betting scenarios
4. Update mock setup orchestrator to include RAG scenarios
5. Ensure proper time distribution (2-30 days old content)

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/mock/generators/rag-demo.ts` | Generate archived content with embeddings for RAG demo | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `scripts/mock/orchestrators/setup.ts` | Add step to archive old content and create RAG demo scenarios | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Create RAG demo data generator**
```typescript
// scripts/mock/generators/rag-demo.ts
export async function archiveOldMockContent() {
  // Archive posts older than specified timeframes
  // Archive bets older than 7 days
  // Archive engagement data older than 3 days
}

export async function createRAGDemoScenarios(mockUsers: User[], games: Game[]) {
  // Create posts with similar captions for AI training
  // Create consensus betting scenarios
  // Generate time-distributed content (2-30 days)
}
```

**Step 2: Update orchestrator**
- Import RAG demo functions
- Call after existing mock data creation
- Ensure proper sequencing

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Generate content across 2-30 day range for varied patterns
- Focus on caption similarity for AI training
- Create clear consensus scenarios for betting alerts

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Sprint 8.02 must be completed (archiving logic in place)
- Existing mock data infrastructure
- Archive columns must exist in database

**Identified Risks**:
- Timing conflicts with production archiving
- Large volume of test data might affect performance

## Key Code Additions

### Archive Pattern for Mock Data
```typescript
// Archive content with specific age ranges
const archiveWithAge = async (table: string, daysOld: number) => {
  const targetDate = new Date();
  targetDate.setDate(targetDate.getDate() - daysOld);
  
  await supabase
    .from(table)
    .update({ archived: true })
    .eq('is_mock', true) // Only archive mock data
    .lt('created_at', targetDate.toISOString());
};
```

### Caption Templates for AI Training
```typescript
const captionTemplates = [
  "Let's go! ðŸ”¥",
  "Easy money tonight ðŸ’°",
  "Lock of the day ðŸ”’",
  "Feeling good about this one ðŸŽ¯",
  "Trust the process ðŸ“ˆ"
];
```

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Mock data creates with correct timestamps
- [ ] Archived content spans 2-30 days
- [ ] Caption patterns are varied but similar
- [ ] Consensus scenarios properly created
- [ ] No interference with production data

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Updated mock data README with RAG scenarios
- [ ] Documented caption patterns for AI training
- [ ] Added examples of consensus betting scenarios
