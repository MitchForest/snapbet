# Epic 03: Camera & Content Creation Tracker

## Epic Overview

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Target End Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Actual End Date**: TBD  

**Epic Goal**: Build a camera-first content creation system with emoji effects, enabling users to create and share three types of ephemeral content (Content, Pick, Outcome) as either posts or stories.

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can capture photos/videos with effects
- Content can be shared as posts or stories
- Three post types supported (content, pick, outcome)
- Feed displays all content types
- Basic engagement UI (comments, reactions, tail/fade)

## Sprint Breakdown

| Sprint # | Sprint Name | Duration | Status | Dependencies |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 03.0 | Profile & Badge Catchup | 1.5 hours | NOT STARTED | Epic 2 complete |
| 03.1 | Camera Foundation | 2 hours | COMPLETED | Epic 2 complete |
| 03.2 | Effects System | 2 hours | MOSTLY COMPLETE | Badge count from 3.0 |
| 03.3 | Post Type System | 1.5 hours | NOT STARTED | Database migration |
| 03.4 | Content Composition | 1.5 hours | NOT STARTED | Camera (3.1) |
| 03.5 | Feed Display | 2 hours | NOT STARTED | Posts in DB (3.4) |
| 03.6 | Engagement UI | 2 hours | NOT STARTED | Feed (3.5) |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 12.5 hours

## Current State Assessment

### Completed Work
- ✅ Camera implementation with photo/video capture (Sprint 3.1)
- ✅ Gallery selection and permissions
- ✅ Media compression and upload service
- ✅ 73 emoji effects across tiers (Sprint 3.2 - mostly done)
- ✅ Effect selector UI with categories
- ✅ Basic profile screen exists

### Remaining Work
- ❌ 8 weekly badges implementation (Sprint 3.0)
- ❌ Badge-effect gating connection
- ❌ Post type infrastructure (Sprint 3.3)
- ❌ Caption and sharing UI (Sprint 3.4)
- ❌ Feed components (Sprint 3.5)
- ❌ Engagement components (Sprint 3.6)

### Database Gaps
- Missing `post_type`, `effect_id`, `comment_count`, `settled_bet_id` columns on posts
- Missing `comments` table entirely
- Missing `story_content_type` on stories
- Missing weekly badge reset tracking

## Architectural Decisions

### Badge System Redesign
**Decision**: Replace current badges with Epic 3's 8 weekly badges
**Rationale**: Weekly resets create more dynamic engagement
**Impact**: Need new badge definitions and calculation logic

### Post Type Infrastructure
**Decision**: Build infrastructure now, defer overlays to Epic 5
**Rationale**: Can't create meaningful overlays without betting data
**Impact**: Focus on type selection and data structure

### Sprint Reordering
**Decision**: Complete 3.0 → 3.4 → 3.5 → 3.3 → 3.6
**Rationale**: Get basic posting working first, then enhance
**Impact**: Users can create content sooner

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── profile/          # Exists, needs badge integration
├── badges/           # Needs weekly badge implementation  
├── camera/           # Mostly complete
├── effects/          # Complete but needs badge connection
├── content/          # Needs PostCard, StoryBar
├── creation/         # Needs caption, share options
└── engagement/       # Needs comments, reactions, tail/fade
```

### State Management
- Badge count needs to be globally accessible for effects
- Content creation flow needs proper state management
- Feed needs pagination and real-time updates

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Database migrations breaking existing data | HIGH | Test thoroughly, backup first |
| Weekly badge calculations performance | MEDIUM | Optimize queries, consider caching |
| Feed performance with media | HIGH | Implement proper lazy loading |
| Effect gating complexity | LOW | Simple badge count check |

## Integration Points

### With Epic 2 (Auth)
- User profiles for attribution
- Badge display in feed
- Auth state for permissions

### With Epic 4 (Feed - Future)
- Real-time updates
- Other users' content
- Full FlashList implementation

### With Epic 5 (Betting)
- Pick post creation from bets
- Outcome posts from results
- Bet overlays on media

## Success Metrics

- Camera opens in < 500ms
- Effects run at 60 FPS
- Post creation < 3 seconds
- Feed scroll performance smooth
- Zero crashes or errors

## Epic Status Log

**2025-01-20**: Epic started, reviewing existing implementation
- Camera foundation already complete (Sprint 3.1)
- Effects mostly implemented (Sprint 3.2)
- Need to implement weekly badges and connect to effects
- Database needs migration for missing fields

## Next Steps

1. Create Sprint 3.0 tracker for weekly badges
2. Create database migration for missing fields
3. Plan component architecture for feed
4. Define exact badge calculation logic
