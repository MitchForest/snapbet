# Sprint 06.07: Production Automation Jobs

## Sprint Details
- **Epic**: 6 - Messaging System & Automation
- **Sprint**: 06.07 - Production Automation Jobs
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Status**: HANDOFF

## Implementation Notes

### Initial Implementation
Completed all 10 job types with BaseJob framework:
1. Content Expiration - Handles posts, stories, messages with soft/hard deletion
2. Bankroll Reset - Weekly reset with referral bonus calculation
3. Badge Calculation - All 8 badge types with award logic
4. Game Settlement - Uses existing settlement service
5. Stats Rollup - Calculates and persists to bankrolls table
6. Cleanup - Removes orphaned data across all tables
7. Media Cleanup - Cleans storage buckets
8. Game Updates - Simulates live score updates
9. Odds Updates - Simulates line movements
10. Notifications - Game starts, outcomes, expiration warnings

### Revised Implementation (After Feedback)
Enhanced all jobs based on gap analysis:
- Fixed stats rollup to persist to bankrolls table (not users)
- Added stories, comments, pick_actions to content expiration
- Created game updates job for live scores
- Created odds updates job with sharp/public money simulation
- Created notifications job with 4 notification types
- Enhanced cleanup for all orphaned data types
- Added proper TypeScript types throughout

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings (all job files)
- ✅ TypeCheck: 0 errors
- ✅ All jobs manually tested with --dry-run
- ✅ Added protected log method to BaseJob
- ✅ Fixed all any types and unused variables

### Key Decisions
1. Used BaseJob abstract class for consistency
2. All jobs support dry-run mode for safety
3. Created job_executions table for tracking
4. Simulated external APIs for demo purposes
5. Added commander CLI for easy execution

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: 12 new files in scripts/jobs/
- Modified: scripts/jobs/types.ts (added log method)
- Modified: package.json (added job scripts)
- Database: Created job_executions table

### Testing Performed
All jobs tested with:
- `bun run jobs:all --dry-run`
- Individual job commands
- Verbose output verification
- Database tracking verification

## Metrics
- **Planned**: 2 hours
- **Actual**: 2.5 hours (includes revision)
- **Complexity**: High (10 job types, database integration)

## Learnings
1. Always do comprehensive gap analysis first
2. Check existing table structures before implementation
3. Stats are in bankrolls table, not users
4. Stories table exists and needs expiration
5. TypeScript strict mode catches many issues early

## Next Steps
- Deploy jobs to Edge Functions when ready
- Set up cron schedules in production
- Monitor job execution metrics
- Add error alerting for failed jobs
