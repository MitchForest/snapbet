# SnapBet PRD

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Build a social sports betting platform that transforms solitary betting into a shared social experience through ephemeral content, tail/fade mechanics, and community engagement.

**Problem Statement**: Sports betting is currently a solo activity despite sports being inherently social. Bettors lack a platform to share picks, celebrate wins, commiserate losses, and build camaraderie around their betting journey. Existing platforms focus on transactions, not community.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Fully functional MVP with core Snapchat-like features by Day 3
- 6 complete RAG-enhanced user stories by Day 7  
- Smooth, native-feeling mobile experience with 60fps animations
- Active user engagement with tail/fade mechanics
- Successful demo showing the social betting experience

## User Stories

### Story 1: Social Pick Sharing
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want to** share my picks with friends through photos/videos  
**So that** I can build credibility and create accountability for my bets

### Story 2: Tail/Fade Decisions  
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want to** quickly tail or fade my friends' picks  
**So that** I can leverage collective knowledge or bet against poor performers

### Story 3: Ephemeral Content
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want** all my content to be ephemeral with appropriate expiration times  
**So that** my feed stays fresh and my bad picks don't haunt me forever

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Pick posts expire at game end (~3 hours after start)
- Outcome posts expire 24 hours after creation
- Content posts expire 24 hours after creation
- Stories always expire after 24 hours
- Clear visual indicators of expiration time
- Cannot interact with expired content

### Story 4: Group Betting Coordination
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want to** coordinate bets with my friend groups through messaging  
**So that** we can share the excitement of wins and losses together

### Story 5: Performance Tracking
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want to** see my stats and others' performance metrics  
**So that** I know who to tail and who to fade

### Story 6: AI-Powered Insights (RAG)
**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want** AI to identify my successful patterns and generate relevant content  
**So that** I can improve my betting and share better content

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits (500/month) | High | Use mock data for MVP, aggressive caching |
| Real-time performance at scale | Medium | Optimize subscriptions, implement pagination |
| Bet settlement accuracy | High | Manual settlement for demo, comprehensive testing |
| Complex tail/fade edge cases | Medium | Clear rules, thorough documentation |
| User adoption | Medium | Launch to r/sportsbook, referral incentives |
| App store approval | Low | Clear "entertainment only" disclaimers |
| Overlay readability | Medium | High contrast design, user testing |

## Open Questions

- Should we support simple 2-3 leg parlays in MVP?
- How do we handle ties/pushes in fade scenarios?
- Should stories auto-generate for milestones?
- What's the max group chat size?
- Do we need a tutorial/onboarding flow?

## Admin Tools

### Settlement & Game Management
- Scripts to add games with mock odds
- Scripts to settle bets with scores
- Scripts to trigger notifications
- Debug panel in app (dev only)
- Ability to reset all data

*See: [Admin Tools Document](./docs/admin-tools.md) for details*

## Notification Strategy

- Comment on your post
- Reaction to your content

## User Acquisition Plan
