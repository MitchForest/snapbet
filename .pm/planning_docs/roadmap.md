## Key Implementation Notes

### Ephemeral Architecture
```typescript
// All content has expiration
interface EphemeralContent {
  id: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
  softDeletedAt?: Date;
  hardDeletedAt?: Date;
}

// Permanent data for trust
interface PermanentRecord {
  userId: string;
  bets: Bet[];
  winLossRecord: Stats;
  weeklySnapshots: WeeklyPerformance[];
}
```

### Weekly Reset System
```typescript
// Every Monday at midnight
async function weeklyReset() {
  // Reset all bankrolls to base + referral bonus
  await resetBankrolls();
  
  // Recalculate all badges
  await calculateWeeklyBadges();
  
  // Archive previous week's performance
  await archiveWeeklyStats();
  
  // Send "Fresh Week" notifications
  await notifyFreshStart();
}
```

### Privacy-First Design
- Private accounts require approval
- Blocked users see nothing
- Display names enable anonymity
- OAuth data never exposed
- Ephemeral by default
