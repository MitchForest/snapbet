- User profiles with usernames and avatars
- Badge system (8 weekly badges)
- Referral tracking system
- Bankroll initialization

### Epic 04: Feed & Social Engagement ‚ú® NEW
**Completed**: 2025-01-10
**Duration**: 23 days (9 sprints)
**Grade**: A+ (One sprint with commendation)

**Key Features Delivered**:
- High-performance social feed with FlashList (60 FPS scrolling)
- User search and discovery with trending/suggested users
- Following system with optimistic updates
- Private accounts with follow request management
- Full engagement system (comments, reactions, tail/fade UI)
- Instagram-style story viewer with reactions
- Comprehensive content moderation (blocking, reporting, auto-hide)
- $100 weekly referral bonus system
- Professional error handling and loading states

**Major Architectural Decisions**:
- **MMKV Storage Service**: 30x performance improvement over AsyncStorage
- **Service Independence**: No service-to-service calls prevent circular dependencies
- **Composite Cursor Pagination**: Stable infinite scroll that handles deletions
- **DeviceEventEmitter**: React Native event communication pattern
- **Defense in Depth**: Error boundaries at multiple levels
- **Smart Memoization**: ~80% reduction in unnecessary re-renders

**Important Learnings**:
- Database migration workflow is critical - always migrate first, regenerate types, then code
- MMKV provides massive performance improvements and should be used everywhere
- Service independence pattern prevents circular dependencies
- Memoization of list items has the biggest performance impact
- Error boundaries at multiple levels prevent app crashes
- Technical debt removal while implementing features is efficient

**Technical Achievements**:
- Zero TypeScript errors throughout epic
- Complete AsyncStorage to MMKV migration
- All database migrations properly applied
- Consistent haptic feedback on all primary actions
- Professional polish with loading states
- One sprint completed with commendation (04.04)

### Epic 05: Betting & Bankroll System ‚ú® NEW
**Completed**: Jan 2025
**Duration**: 8 sprints
**Grade**: A

**Key Features Delivered**:
- Games tab with NBA/NFL games and odds (mock data)
- 10-second bet placement flow with bottom sheet UI
- Tail/fade mechanics integrated with feed posts
- $1,000 weekly bankroll with automatic Monday reset
- Bet settlement system with admin scripts
- Pick/outcome post creation via camera
- Bet history with performance stats (W-L, ROI)

**Major Architectural Decisions**:
- **Bankroll in Cents**: Store as 100000 for $1,000 to avoid float precision issues
- **Mock Data Structure**: Follow The Odds API format for easy future migration
- **Single Bookmaker**: Display one set of odds for cleaner UI
- **Client-side ROI**: Calculate stats on client for MVP simplicity
- **Atomic Transactions**: Prevent bankroll race conditions with DB locks

**Important for Future Epics**:
- **Bet Relationships**: pick_actions table tracks tail/fade relationships
- **Game Scores**: Settlement scripts update scores in games table
- **Post Integration**: Pick posts link to bets via bet_id in metadata
- **Referral Bonuses**: $100 added to weekly bankroll per active referral
- **Effect Suggestions**: Outcome posts suggest effects based on win/loss

**Technical Achievements**:
- Zero TypeScript errors in betting system
- Zero ESLint warnings in betting code
- 60 FPS on games list using FlashList
- Real-time tail/fade count updates
- Optimistic UI for instant feedback

## üö® CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR FUTURE EPICS üö®

### Development Environment
**MUST use development builds - Expo Go will NOT work:**
```bash
# Daily development
bun expo start --dev-client  # NOT 'bun expo start'
```

### OAuth Authentication Quirks
1. **Supabase returns tokens in URL fragment**: Must parse `#` not `?`
2. **Database trigger auto-creates users**: Uses schema-qualified enums
3. **Session detection needs retries**: 3 attempts for reliability
4. **Google needs email scope**: 60-second timeout for 2FA

### Architectural Patterns (MANDATORY)

#### Storage Pattern (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// Use unified MMKV service - 30x faster than AsyncStorage
import { Storage } from '@/services/storage/storageService';
Storage.feed.set('key', value);
```

#### Pagination Pattern (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// Composite cursor for stable pagination
interface Cursor {
  timestamp: string;
  id: string;
}
```

#### List Performance (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// FlashList for ALL lists > 10 items
<FlashList
  estimatedItemSize={400}
  drawDistance={1000}
  removeClippedSubviews={true}
/>
```

#### UI Consistency
- **Tamagui only**: No React Native components
- **Colors constant**: Never hardcode colors
- **ScreenHeader**: For all drawer screens
- **Text icons**: Use "‚Üê" not icon libraries

#### Service Independence Pattern (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// Services NEVER call other services
// Pass data as parameters instead
async function doSomething(userId: string, isPrivate: boolean) {
  // NOT: const isPrivate = await privacyService.check(userId)
}
```

#### Error Boundary Pattern (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// Root level AND tab level for defense in depth
<ErrorBoundary level="root">
  <ErrorBoundary level="tab">
    <YourComponent />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### Event Communication Pattern (NEW from Epic 4)
```typescript
// Use DeviceEventEmitter for React Native, NEVER browser APIs
import { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native';
DeviceEventEmitter.emit('event', data);
```

### Critical Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Impact | Reason |
|----------|--------|---------|
| OAuth-only (no email/password) | All epics | Reduce friction, modern auth |
| Development builds required | All epics | OAuth deep linking |
| MMKV storage service | Epic 4+ | 30x performance gain |
| FlashList for feeds | Epic 4+ | 60 FPS with media |
| Composite cursor pagination | Epic 4+ | Handles deletions gracefully |
| Real-time subscription limits | Epic 4+ | Cap at 100 for performance |
| Weekly badge system | Epic 3+ | 8 badges, Monday reset |
| Three post types | Epic 3+ | Content, Pick, Outcome |
| Supabase MCP for DB inspection | All epics | Real-time schema understanding |
| Service independence | Epic 4+ | Prevents circular dependencies |
| Error boundaries everywhere | Epic 4+ | Prevents app crashes |
| DeviceEventEmitter pattern | Epic 4+ | Cross-component communication |

### Code Quality Standards
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint/type errors
- **Type generation**: After EVERY schema change
- **No `any` types**: Without explicit justification
- **Migration files**: For EVERY database change
