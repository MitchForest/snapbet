**So that** I can make informed decisions about who to follow and whose picks to trust

**The Problem**:

**I want** my betting content to disappear after it's relevant  
**So that** I can share authentically without fear of my bad picks haunting me forever

**The Problem**: 
"I'm afraid to share my picks because my bad weeks will haunt me forever. I don't want potential employers seeing my degen parlays from college. I want to live in the moment without building a permanent record of failure."

**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want to** share my picks with personality and style  
**So that** my betting content is as entertaining as my wins feel

**I want to** connect with others on my betting journey  
**So that** wins feel more celebrated and losses feel less painful

**The Problem**:

**I want** AI to help me find bettors who match my style  
**So that** I can build a network of like-minded people to follow and engage with

**As a** semi-casual sports bettor  
**I want** AI to intelligently filter my notifications  
**So that** I see important picks without drowning in noise

**The Problem**: 
"I'm either missing great picks from people I trust or getting spammed with notifications I don't care about. I need to know when my sharp friends are betting, but I don't need alerts every time someone I barely know posts a 12-leg parlay."
